This project looks at cost of tuition over time from 1985-2017 for Harvard University. It uses the undergraduate information from a Kaggle dataset available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harvard-university/harvard-tuition). It has information about cost of room, board, health services, student fees, tuition, and overall total for each year in the 1985 to 2017 range. Understanding how the cost of higher education changes over time is important for making the decision of whether or not to attend and commit to paying off the total cost of tuition for a four year degree.
